# Svítej

Knížka vítej implementovaná jako webová aplikace ve Svelte.

## TODO

### Settings

- [x] Reorder languages
  - [ ] If we have more languages: allow disabling some languages
  - [ ] Alternatively, replace by [always selecting two languages](#Languages)
- [x] Autoplay
  - [ ] More options: one/many languages, one/many pages
- [ ] Playback speed
- [ ] Wait time between paragraphs/pages
- [ ] Persist/cache settings
- [ ] Allow alphabet conversions

### Reading flow

- [ ] Pagination, page jumping
- [ ] Playback across pages, with smooth jumps

### Presentation

- [ ] Better UI in general
- [ ] Inform about landscape mode on mobile

### Languages

- [ ] Generalise the website into multiple localisations (info/settings/... – not the actual book texts)
- [ ] Instead of arbitrary ordering, always select just two languages (and thus get their order implicitly)
- [ ] Auto translation
- [ ] Auto TTS

General Svelte instructions are below.

## svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

### Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

### Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

### Single-page app mode

By default, sirv will only respond to requests that match files in `public`. This is to maximise compatibility with static fileservers, allowing you to deploy your app anywhere.

If you're building a single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes, sirv needs to be able to respond to requests for _any_ path. You can make it so by editing the `"start"` command in package.json:

```js
"start": "sirv public --single"
```

### Deploying to the web

#### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
cd public
vercel deploy --name my-project
```

#### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g surge
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public my-project.surge.sh
```
